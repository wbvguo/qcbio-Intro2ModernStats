# UCLA QCBio Collaboratory Workshop W14: Introduction to Modern Statistics
Author: Wenbin Guo  
Last Update: 2025 Winter  

## Description
This workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to modern statistics, covering essential concepts in probability, statistical inference, and modeling. Participants will gain both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience with key statistical techniques, including classical methods (e.g., hypothesis testing, regression analysis) and computational approaches (e.g., permutation tests, bootstrapping). Through interactive exercises and real-world examples, attendees will build a strong foundation in statistical reasoning, enhance their data analysis skills in R, sharpen their mind on data-driven decision-making and gain critical insights into common statistical pitfalls. For registration information, please refer to this [link](https://qcb.ucla.edu/collaboratory/workshops).


## Schedule
This workshop is taught every quarter (3-day workshop, 3 hours per day).

### Day 1: Probability and Statistics Basics
- Introduction to uncertainty and probability  
- Probability distributions (Discrete and Continuous)  
- Descriptive statistics: central tendency, dispersion, and skewness  
- Hands-on practice with statistical programming in R

### Day 2: Statistical Inference  
- Introduction to inferential statistics  
- Hypothesis testing: p-values and decision errors  
- Permutation test and bootstrap for robust inference  
- Multiple testing correction and controlling false discovery rate  

### Day 3: Statistical Modeling
- Likelihood and Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)  
- Regression techniques: linear, logistic, local, and penalized regression  
- Model selection approaches (AIC, BIC, cross-validation)  
- Common statistical fallacies and pitfalls  

## Requirements
### Technical:  
R/RStudio  

### Prerequisite:  
Participants should have some familiarities with R programming.
